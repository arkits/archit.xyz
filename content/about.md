As an introvert, I have learnt how to display great patience, withhold my views. Of course, this results in moments where I need to let it all out and this offers me a chance to do that.

Being loud and repetitive gets more ears and eyes. I am a mirror image of our society, so here’s hoping obnoxious works just as well.

I am most ticked off by hypocrisy, pseudo-socio-cultural behaviour, overly diplomatic and politically statements.

This where I rant and reason.

> Cautionary note: Don’t be offended.

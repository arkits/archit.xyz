I could not access the `arkits/ludo` repository from the public GitHub URL, so this is a placeholder draft.

## What I Need To Finalize This Post

- The README or a short project summary.
- The tech stack (language, frameworks, hosting).
- Core features or gameplay loop.
- Anything that makes this project unique.

Once I have those details, I can turn this into a full post matching the tone and depth of the others.
